Introduction

Protocol Name: Compound

Category: DeFi

Smart Contract:`Comptroller`

## Function Analysis

**Function Name:** `_delegateCompLikeTo`

**Block Explorer Link:** [Etherscan](https://etherscan.io/address/0x3d9819210a31b4961b30ef54be2aed79b9c9cd3b#code)

**Function Code:**

```solidity
function _delegateCompLikeTo(address compLikeDelegatee) external {
    require(msg.sender == admin, "only the admin may set the comp-like delegate");
    require(compLikeDelegatee != address(0), "comp-like delegatee cannot be zero address");

    address currentCompLikeDelegatee = delegateCompLike;
    delegateCompLike = compLikeDelegatee;

    // Perform the delegate call to set the new delegate
    (bool success, bytes memory data) = compLikeDelegatee.delegatecall(
        abi.encodeWithSignature("delegateCompLike(address)", currentCompLikeDelegatee)
    );

    require(success, "delegatecall to compLikeDelegatee failed");
}
```

**Used Encoding/Decoding or Call Method:** `abi.encodeWithSignature`, `delegatecall`

## Explanation

**Purpose:**
The `_delegateCompLikeTo` function is used to delegate the control of COMP-like tokens to another contract or address. This is a governance-related functionality that enables the Compound protocol to assign a new delegate for handling COMP-like tokens without transferring the ownership of the tokens themselves.

**Detailed Usage:**
- **Encoding/Decoding:** The function uses `abi.encodeWithSignature` to encode the function signature and the address of the current delegate. This encoding ensures that the delegatecall made to the `compLikeDelegatee` address knows exactly which function to execute and with what parameters.
- **High/Low-Level Call:** The function utilizes `delegatecall` to execute the `delegateCompLike` function on the `compLikeDelegatee` contract. The `delegatecall` allows the called contract to execute its code within the context of the calling contract's storage, msg.sender, and msg.value. This means the state changes made by the delegate contract will affect the storage of the `Comptroller` contract.

**Impact:**
- **Functionality Contribution:** The `_delegateCompLikeTo` function is crucial for maintaining flexible and upgradeable governance within the Compound protocol. It allows the protocol to update or change the delegate responsible for managing COMP-like tokens without altering the contract that holds these tokens. This mechanism is particularly important for governance and the continuous development of the protocol.
- **Security and Efficiency:** By using `delegatecall`, the protocol can delegate responsibility without transferring assets, reducing the risk associated with moving tokens across different contracts. It also allows for modular upgrades and changes in the delegate contract without needing to redeploy the main `Comptroller` contract.
